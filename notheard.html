                    Many women feel they are not being listened to about their health needs - with older women feeling
                    “invisible” to health professionals, and women throughout their lives experiencing a lack of empathy
                    around problems relating to menstruation, fertility, childbirth and menopause.

                <h2>Why is This Happening?</h2>
                <p>The main challenges in women's health stem from decades, if not centuries, of gender bias and
                    discrimination. In the past, many women's health complaints were attributed to being emotional or
                    hysterical and these gender stereotypes often led to doctors mistreating women's symptoms as a
                    mental health condition, rather than a physical condition.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While that has changed, much of this inherent gender bias remains, with many clinical trials and
                    research studies <strong>not assessing the impact on women</strong>. There is a gender-based
                    data gap but now we need to overcome this. Data sets are very rarely analysed by gender, and yet it
                    is almost universally recorded, so the disparities in how genders respond in different disease
                    groups could and should be analysed routinely.

                <h2>Mental Helath and Suicide in Young People</h2>
                <p>
                    One in five young women who have sought help for their mental health say they were told they were
                    being “dramatic”, according to a new survey.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The YouGov survey, which was commissioned by the suicide prevention charity Campaign Against Living
                    Miserably (Calm), asked more than 2,000 women about their experiences when asking for help with a
                    mental health crisis such as panic attacks or manic depression. It found that many women did not
                    feel they were taken seriously.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A third said they were asked if they were “overthinking things,” while 20% were asked if they were
                    on their period and 27% were told their issues could be hormonal. The survey found that 22% of the
                    women feared being seen as “attention-seeking”.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Among women under 25, the suicide rate is increasing, according to ONS statistics, and now stands at
                    one every two days.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that suicide rates among women under
                    the age of 25 in the UK are increasing and stand at one every two days. An ONS release says:
                    “Suicide rates among young females have been steadily increasing over several years. While
                    year-on-year changes might not be statistically significant, comparison between 2015 and 2021 shows
                    a statistically significant increase for those aged 10 to 24 and 25 to 44 years.”
