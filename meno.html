            <h1>Menopause</h1>
            <div class="info-divs">
                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>For most women, menopause is marked by the end of monthly menstruation (also known as a menstrual
                    period or 'period')
                    due to loss of ovarian follicular function. This means that the ovaries stop releasing eggs for
                    fertilisation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The regularity and length of the menstrual cycle varies across a woman's reproductive life span, but
                    the age at
                    which natural menopause occurs is generally between 45 and 55 years for women worldwide.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Natural menopause is deemed to have occurred after 12 consecutive months without menstruation for
                    which there is no
                    other obvious physiological or pathological cause and in the absence of clinical intervention.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some women experience menopause earlier (before 40 years of age). This 'premature menopause' may be
                    because of
                    certain chromosomal abnormalities, autoimmune disorders, or other unknown causes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It is not possible to predict when an individual woman will experience menopause, although there are
                    associations
                    between the age at menopause and certain demographic, health, and genetic factors.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Menopause can also be induced as a consequence of surgical procedures that involve removal of both
                    ovaries or
                    medical interventions that cause cessation of ovarian function (for example radiation therapy or
                    chemotherapy).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Many women have already stopped menstruating before menopause, for example those who have had
                    certain surgical
                    procedures (hysterectomy or surgical removal of their uterine lining) as well as those using certain
                    hormonal
                    contraceptives and other medicines that cause infrequent or absent periods. They may still
                    experience other changes
                    related to the menopausal transition.

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>The hormonal changes associated with menopause can affect physical, emotional, mental, and social
                    well-being. The
                    symptoms experienced during and following the menopausal transition vary substantially from person
                    to person. Some
                    have few if any symptoms. For others, symptoms can be severe and affect daily activities and quality
                    of life. Some
                    can experience symptoms for several years.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Symptoms associated with menopause include:</p>
                <ul class="info-list">
                    <li>hot flushes and night sweats. Hot flushes refer to a sudden feeling of heat in the face,
                        neck and chest, often
                        accompanied by flushing of the skin, perspiration (sweating), palpitations, and acute
                        feelings of physical
                        discomfort which can last several minutes</li>
                    <li>changes in the regularity and flow of the menstrual cycle, culminating in cessation of
                        menstruation</li>
                    <li>vaginal dryness, pain during sexual intercourse and incontinence</li>
                    <li>difficulty sleeping/insomnia</li>
                    <li>changes in mood, depression, and/or anxiety</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    Body composition and cardiovascular risk can also be affected. Women's advantage over men in terms
                    of cardiovascular
                    disease gradually disappears with the significant decline in oestrogen levels after menopause.
                    Menopause can also result
                    in the weakening of the pelvic support structures, increasing the risk of pelvic organ prolapse.
                    Loss of bone density at
                    menopause is a significant contributor to higher rates of osteoporosis and fractures.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are a variety of non-hormonal and hormonal interventions that can help alleviate symptoms of
                    menopause. Symptoms
                    that impact on health and well-being should be discussed with a health-care provider to identify
                    available management
                    options, with consideration of medical history, values, and preferences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. Contraception is recommended to avoid unintended
                    pregnancy until after
                    12 consecutive months without menstruation. Pregnancy after menopause is unlikely without fertility
                    treatment that
                    involves the use of donor eggs or previously frozen embryos.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    During perimenopause and following menopause, it is still possible to acquire sexually-transmitted
                    infections (STIs),
                    including HIV, through unprotected sexual contact, including oral, anal, and vaginal sex. The
                    thinning of the vaginal
                    wall after menopause increases the chances of lesions and tears, thereby increasing the risk of HIV
                    transmission during
                    vaginal sex.
