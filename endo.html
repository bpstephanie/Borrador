            <h1>Endometriosis</h1>
            <div class="info-divs">
                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the
                    uterus.
                    It can cause severe pain in the pelvis and make it harder to get pregnant.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Endometriosis can start at a person's first menstrual period and last until menopause.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With endometriosis, tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. This leads
                    to
                    inflammation and scar tissue forming in the pelvic region and (rarely) elsewhere in the body.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There is no known way to prevent endometriosis. There is no cure, but its symptoms can be treated
                    with
                    medicines or, in some cases, surgery. It causes a chronic inflammatory reaction that may result in
                    the
                    formation of scar tissue (adhesions, fibrosis) within the pelvis and other parts of the body.
                    Several
                    lesion types have been described:
                    <br>
                    <ul class="info-list">
                        <br>
                        <li>superficial endometriosis found mainly on the pelvic peritoneum</li>
                        <li>cystic ovarian endometriosis (endometrioma) found in the ovaries</li>
                        <li>deep endometriosis found in the recto-vaginal septum, bladder, and bowel</li>
                        <li>in rare cases, endometriosis has also been found outside the pelvis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-divs">
                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Endometriosis often causes severe pain in the pelvis, especially during menstrual periods. Some
                    people
                    also have pain during sex or when using the bathroom. Some people have trouble getting pregnant.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some people with endometriosis don't have any symptoms. For those who do, a common symptom is pain
                    in
                    the lower part of the belly (pelvis). Pain may be most noticeable:
                    
                    <ul class="info-list">
                        <br>
                        <li>during a period</li>
                        <li>during or after sex</li>
                        <li>when urinating or defecating</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Some people also experience:
                    <ul class="info-list">
                        <br>
                        <li>chronic pelvic pain</li>
                        <li>heavy bleeding during periods or between periods</li>
                        <li>trouble getting pregnant</li>
                        <li>bloating or nausea</li>
                        <li>fatigue</li>
                        <li>depression or anxiety</li>
                        <br>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symptoms often improve after menopause, but not always.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Endometriosis symptoms are <strong>variable and broad</strong>, meaning that healthcare workers may
                    not
                    easily diagnose it. Individuals with symptoms may not be aware of the condition.
                </p>

            <div class="info-divs">
                <h2>Treatment</h2>
                <p>Treatments to manage endometriosis can vary based on the severity of symptoms and whether pregnancy
                    is
                    desired. No treatments cure the disease.
                    <br>
                    A range of medications can help manage endometriosis and its symptoms.
                    <br>
                    Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics (painkillers) like ibuprofen and
                    naproxen
                    are
                    often used to treat pain.
                    <br>
                    Hormonal medicines like GnRH-analogues and contraceptive (birth control) methods can also help
                    control
                    pain.
                    These methods include:
                    <ul class="info-list">
                        <li>pills</li>
                        <li>hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs)</li>
                        <li>vaginal rings</li>
                        <li>implants</li>
                        <li>injections</li>
                        <li>patches</li>
                    </ul>
                    These methods may not be suitable for those wanting to get pregnant.
                    <br>
                    Fertility medicines and procedures are sometimes used for those having difficulty getting pregnant
                    because
                    of endometriosis.
                    <br>
                    Surgery is sometimes used to remove endometriosis lesions, adhesions and scar tissues. Laparoscopic
                    surgery
                    (using a small camera to visualize inside the body) allows doctors to keep incisions small.</p>
